Vitamins are distinct in several ways from other biologically important compounds such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although these latter substances also are indispensable for proper bodily functions, almost all of them can be synthesized by animals in adequate quantities. </p></div>
      <div class="p2"><p>Vitamins, on the other hand, generally cannot be synthesized in amounts sufficient to meet bodily needs and therefore must be obtained from the diet or from some synthetic source. For this reason, vitamins are called essential nutrients. Vitamins also differ from the other biological compounds in that relatively small quantities are needed to complete their functions. In general these functions are of a catalytic or regulatory nature, facilitating or controlling vital chemical reactions in the bodyâ€™s cells. If a vitamin is absent from the diet or is not properly absorbed by the body, a specific deficiency disease may develop.</p></div>
      <div class="p3"><p>Vitamins are usually designated by selected letters of the alphabet, as in vitamin D or vitamin C, though they are also designated by chemical names, such as niacin and folic acid. Biochemists traditionally separate them into two groups, the water-soluble vitamins and the fat-soluble vitamins. The common and chemical names of vitamins of both groups, along with their main biological functions and deficiency symptoms, are listed in the table.</p></div>
      <div class="p4"><p>There are a number of organic compounds that, although related to the vitamins in activity, cannot be defined as true vitamins; normally they can be synthesized by humans in adequate amounts and therefore are not required in the diet. These substances usually are classified with the B vitamins, however, because of similarities in biological function or distribution in foods.</p></div>
      <div class="p5"><p>Lipoic acid has a coenzyme function similar to that of thiamin. Although it is apparently an essential nutrient for some microorganisms, no deficiency in mammals has been observed; therefore, lipoic acid is not considered a true vitamin.</p></div>
